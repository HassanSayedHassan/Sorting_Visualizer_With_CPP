# Sorting Visualizer

This C++ project utilizes the SDL2 library to visualize the step-by-step execution of various sorting algorithms. The implemented algorithms include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms for enhanced understanding.
- User-friendly controls for selecting different algorithms and generating randomized lists.
- Fixed list size of 130 elements to maintain consistency in visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have SDL2 installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HassanSayedHassan/Sorting_Visualize_with_cpp.git`
3. Compile and run the project using a C++ compiler.

## Controls

- Press `0` to generate a new randomized list.
- Press `1` to start Selection Sort.
- Press `2` to start Insertion Sort.
- Press `3` to start Bubble Sort.
- Press `4` to start Merge Sort.
- Press `5` to start Quick Sort.
- Press `6` to start Heap Sort.
- Press `q` to exit the Sorting Visualizer.

## Dependencies

- SDL2 library
